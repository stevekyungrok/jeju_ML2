## The proposal for Machine Learning Camp in Jeju Island

My goal is, by using Tensor Flow's imagine recognition model, to make the program examining illegal words automatically for online shopping websites.
The model finds a word illegal on the every page of shopping mall.
Although the idea is very simple, it will give a huge effect on the online shopping industry.
Every page of online shopping malls, which vendors upload to promote and sell their products, must be examined whether the page includes any illegal words.
For example, if a content contains a word “healing”, illegal to use on online commercials, must be detected and deleted in advance. However, there is no program yet. Every word is looked for and deleted by human beings, not by a program.
In every online shopping mall such as Coupang, ebay etc., dozens of people are hired spending a lot of time to find that kind of words.
Furthermore, there are so many words are illegal to use that (more than hundreds) workers often miss the words and it causes a legal problem.

I strongly believe that Tensor Flow works more accurately and rapidly than how the traditional way does.

What if we let Tensor Flow find those words?
At least 2 millions USD and thousands of hours can be saved per year.

The workflow of the idea is the same as below:

  1. Vendors upload contents(jpg file)
  2. Tensor model look for any illegal words to delete (This is the goal)
  3. If any found, Tensor locate and delete them
  4. The cleaned contents are saved and uploaded on website

During the camp, I will focus on programming number 2. however, If it is possible, I will keep moving to the next step.


## Can you find the word "Ticket Monster(티몬)" on the below image?
## This kind of word is mistakenly uploaded on the wrong website.
